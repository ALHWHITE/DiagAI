**DiagAI: An Offline AI-Powered Diagnostic Assistant for Rural Africa**

**DiagAI** is a low-cost, offline, AI-based diagnostic tool designed to assist health workers in rural African clinics where internet, electricity, and trained professionals are scarce. In many of these communities, frontline health workers must rely on guesswork or limited experience to diagnose common diseases like malaria, pneumonia, skin infections, and gastrointestinal disorders. Misdiagnosis leads to delayed treatments, complications, or even preventable deaths.

DiagAI addresses this critical healthcare gap by embedding lightweight machine learning models into compact, energy-efficient devices like Raspberry Pi Zero or ESP32 microcontrollers. These models are trained to recognize disease patterns through user-inputted symptoms, images (e.g. skin rashes or blood smears), or audio (like cough sounds), using datasets such as MedMNIST, Coswara, and the Malaria Cell Images dataset.

Unlike traditional apps, DiagAI works fully offline. It doesn’t depend on cloud computing or internet connectivity, making it perfect for remote environments. The system runs on solar power or rechargeable batteries, using a simple touch interface or keypad for interaction. It also supports multilingual text and audio guidance for ease of use among low-literacy users.

From a technology standpoint, DiagAI uses **TinyML**, **TensorFlow Lite**, and **Flask-based interfaces**, delivering fast, accurate predictions on low-power hardware. Benchmark tests show diagnosis accuracy above 90% for malaria and 85% for respiratory symptoms — all while consuming less than 1.5W of power.

Ultimately, DiagAI empowers community health workers with instant, AI-guided diagnosis — reducing dependence on overburdened doctors and improving early intervention. It is a scalable, sustainable, and ethical solution that combines **AI**, **IoT**, and **local innovation** to transform rural healthcare in Africa. With minimal cost and maximum impact, DiagAI represents the kind of tech Africa needs — smart, inclusive, and built for real-world challenges.
